Mini project for pagination of the git data
- Check the package.JSON for dependencies to install

- The API end point is a bit different as it is not getting all the repositories and not getting score, default sorting is done by ID (that is just a matter of changing endpoint.

- Pagination is happening fully on the front end (this could also be done by asking for already paginated results from API which would've been a bit cleaner but I have not seen that coming at first.

Other than that it is pretty straight forward javascript.
In case of questions let me know by email, thanks for checking.
